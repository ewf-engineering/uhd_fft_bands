# uhd_fft_bands
This is an update to the default uhd_fft script that comes with the UHD libarary and GNU radio. In this project I added -r and -ch arguments and removed the mandatory -f argument.
This script runs locally and the only requirement is to put the uhd_app_bands.py script in the /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/uhd/ folder with the origional uhd_app.py script.

I did a whole write up about my changes to the origional and it can be found on my blog!
